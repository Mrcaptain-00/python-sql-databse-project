# python-sql-databse-project
This is a Telecom Subscriber Management System inspired by the functioning of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI). Developed using Python, MySQL, Pandas, and Matplotlib, the project offers a complete backend simulation for managing telecom subscribers and their identity details.

The system supports data insertion, update, deletion, search, and sorting functionalities—making it a mini-CRM-like interface for telecom operations.

💡 Key Features:
📥 Add / Update Subscriber Details
Add new subscribers or update existing records with data such as name, phone number, network provider, and network type.

🧾 Manage Identity Records
Insert or update identity data including IMSI, MCC, MSIN, and ICCID, linked to subscriber IDs.

🔍 Search Functionality
Retrieve subscriber details based on criteria like ID, name, phone number, or MCC code.

📊 Data Visualization & Sorting
Use Pandas to display data in tabular form and sort it by various fields such as name, ID, or network type.

🗑️ Delete Subscriber Data
Remove subscriber entries from both main and identity databases.

🧠 Menu-Driven Interface
A clean, console-based interface with user authentication and runtime menu-driven navigation.
